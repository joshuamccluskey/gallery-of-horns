### Reflections and Comments

I was time boxing today, and I thought this lab would take me longer when I started. As worked through the lab, I started to feel the repetition and pattern, which helped me through the lab. Time boxing is helped a lot!

### Reflections & Comments

It was surprising to see the actual amount of  time spent on the features against initial estimates. I've been using the Pomodoro method for time boxing  25 minute rounds to increase efficiency, and I see the time I spent with each feature falls  closely to each cycle. Can't wait to learn more about Bootstrap!
